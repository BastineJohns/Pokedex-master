# Features:
- created image dataset by using Microsoftâ€™s Bing Image Search API to programmatically download images via a query
- added more images to the dataset by taking existing images and applying transformations to generate more image data
- constructed a Keras model by following VGGNet CNN architecture
- uses Adam Optimizer and Categorical Cross-entropy loss
- achieves 97.49% training accuracy and 88.76% validation accuracy for classifying pokemon images
- currently classifies 12 different Pokemon (Pikachu, Charmander, Charmeleon, Charizard, Squirtle, Wartortle, Blastoise, Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, Venusaur, Gyarados, Rayquaza)
